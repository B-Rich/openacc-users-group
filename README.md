# Project Name
OpenACC Lectures and Code Samples

## About
The goal of this project is to learn from each other on how to use OpenACC. Sharing lecture materials and sample codes amongst us will enable each of us to actively engage the OpenACC user community and educate them to learn on how to create a portable scientific code using OpenACC without compromising on performance and accuracy. 

## Contribution Guidelines

### PolyBench-ACC
Main Contributor: William Killian <killian@udel.edu> - University of Delaware
Based off work by: Louis-Noel Pouchet <pouchet@cse.ohio-state.edu> - Ohio State University

This benchmark suite is partially derived from the PolyBench benchmark suite developed by [Louis-Noel Pouchet](pouchet@cs.ucla.edu) and available at http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~pouchet/software/polybench/

Codes are separated into the following categories: data mining, linear-algebra/kernels, linear-algebra/solvers, and stencils.
